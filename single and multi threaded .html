        // single threaded
    //     let me give u  Eg 
    //     there is only one in the city. In front of the shop there are five people 
    // in a queue and two of them are friend and they line up together in the middle
    //  of the queue to buy ticket but in there one of them has forgot his wallet in his house
    // and he has no money to buy it. So he has to go back home. It will take 10 min 
    // to arrive back here. If he leaves (here) from the place he has arrived right now, 
    // he will has to line up from the start not from his place before. 

    // there are three boys walking in the street they are heading to go to the park and one of them has forgot to close the door before walking. So he has to go back home.Before he go he said you guy keep going I will come along later. It is sure he will come back and he knonw where the park is  

    // called as asynchronous

    // multi threaded
    // This time there are two shop in the city. Condition is exactly the same like the first eg. that can be either instead of lining up in the end he will buy it another shop or may be he isn't coming back. Even if he comes back. they can't sit watch movies together 

    // not sure to come and may be he get lost.
